# Project426
This is a project I created for my Comp 426 final project.
I created a website with a tic tac toe game and a leaderboard. I created a feature where users can create a new account and log into their respective accounts.
Once they log in, they can see the actual tic tac toe game and the leaderboard.
The leaderboard keeps track of the users with the most games won and how many games they have won in total.
I created the leaderboard and user accounts using a SQLite database.
I also incorporated two APIS where one generates a random joke and another one generates a random piece of advice.
Further, I created a FAQ section with autocomplete capability to answer any questions about the tic tac toe game.
I hope you enjoy this website and game!
